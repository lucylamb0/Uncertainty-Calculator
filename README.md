# Uncertainty-Calculator
A very simple uncertainty calculator using sympy that I made for use in Science labs at University

**Installation of Modules:**
To run this script the module 'sympy' is needed which can be installed using pipinstaller:
'pip3 install sympy' or 'pip install sympy'

**Info:**
This script could be heavily improved looked wise and could also be made to have a GUI instead of being through console input however this script was made to simplify my life in my Uni Studies
Because of this the ability to use your own symbols for variables is not present and only the symbols; 'A,B,C,D,E,F,G' can be used for an equation.

To use just run the script using python with sympy installed and input: the number of variables used in your equation, the equation itself, and then the values and uncertainties for each variable.
